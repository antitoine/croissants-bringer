                Every monday, someone in the participant list will be selected to be the croissants bringer of the week.
                You will receive a slack message to ask you if you can bring croissants this friday and you need to respond yes or no.
            </p>

            <h3>Yes, you can !</h3>
            <p>
                Great! You will need to buy croissants this friday.
                Try to know how many people will be present friday morning, and buy one or two croissants by participants.
            </p>

            <h3>No, you can't...</h3>
            <p>
                It's not a big deal, but prepare yourself to be the croissants bringer the next week.
                Another toHero participant will be selected for this week.

            <p>
                The algorithms is very fair! Any participant will be the croissants bringer.
                The one with the lowest participation will be selected and every things is stored in database (soon in blockchain to be sure).
