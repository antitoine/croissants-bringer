    working: 'How does it work ?'
    working_description: |
      Every monday, someone in the participant list will be selected to be the croissants bringer of the week.
      You will receive a slack message to ask you if you can bring croissants this friday and you need to respond yes or no.
    yes: 'Yes, you can !'
    yes_description: |
      Great! You will need to buy croissants this friday.
      Try to know how many people will be present friday morning, and buy one or two croissants by participants.
    no: "No, you can't..."
    no_description: |
      It's not a big deal, but prepare yourself to be the croissants bringer the next week.
      Another toHero participant will be selected for this week.
    selection_proccess: 'How the croissants bringer is selected ?'
    selection_proccess_description: |
      The algorithm is as honest as possible! All participants will bring crescents while respecting fairness.
      The person with the largest position will be selected. Once accepted, its position is equal to the total number of participants.
      To each new provider of croissants, all positions are decremented by one position, so we find a principle of waiting thread.
      The new entrants start from the zero position and therefore will not immediately be the next contributor.
      All participations are recorded in the database (and soon in the blockchain).
    stop: 'And if I want to stop ?'
    stop_description: |
      You can stop whenever you want and for whatever reason (plan, savings, strikes...).
      To do this, go to your account and change your status to inactive.
